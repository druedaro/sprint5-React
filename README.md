## 📦 Sprint 5 – React

This repository contains the completed project for Sprint 5 of the IT Academy Frontend course, focused on building a responsive landing page using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

### 📝 Project Overview

The goal of this sprint is to create a modern, responsive landing page by migrating a previous HTML/CSS project to React. The project is structured into reusable components, uses TypeScript for type safety, and leverages Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and responsive design.

Key features include a mobile hamburger menu, tabbed features section, extension download cards, and a FAQ accordion—all built with accessibility and best practices in mind.
